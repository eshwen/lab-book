\chapter{Using NumPy and root\_numpy (19/07/2017)}

\texttt{NumPy} (\url{http://www.numpy.org/}) is a Python package that can handle scientific computing. It's installed by default with \texttt{pip} and recent (70X and later) CMSSW releases. It's part of the SciPy ecosystem that also includes \texttt{pandas}, \texttt{matplotlib} and \texttt{IPython}. There's another package called \texttt{root\_numpy} that, among other things, can

\begin{easylist}
\ListProperties(Style*=-- , FinalMark={)})
& convert ROOT TTrees into \texttt{NumPy} arrays, and vice versa
& make use of \texttt{matplotlib} for plotting
& make use of \texttt{pandas} and its dataframes for data analysis (like AlphaTwirl)
& make use of \texttt{scikit-learn} for machine learning
\end{easylist}

\texttt{root\_numpy} is installed by default only in very recent CMSSW releases (92X and later), but can be installed with pip as well. A good primer for \texttt{root\_numpy} is \url{http://scikit-hep.org/root_numpy/index.html}.
