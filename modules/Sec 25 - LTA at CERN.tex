One of the parks of my PhD is a long term posting (LTA) at CERN. Usually, students go for at least a year, and we have funding for a placement of up to 18 months. I'll probably apply for 12 months, and then possibly extend it if I want to stay (as long as I give the UK Liaison Office, UKLO, at least 3 months notice). Being funded by the STFC, I can only start my LTA on specific dates (listed here: \url{https://www.ppd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/For-Students-Only.aspx}). The 10\textsuperscript{th} October is the most ideal one, so I'll have to find accommodation in Bristol until the end of September/beginning of October. Once Bjoern gives the go-ahead, I need to complete the form on the website requesting accommodation (which is all paid for by the STFC). I should also let Briony Spraggon know so she can notify the STFC of the dates for insurance purposes, and to start preparing the finances.

On the accommodation application form, I've written the start date as 10th October 2017 and the end date as 21st September 2018 (the latest date available on the web page). I have emailed Briony with the dates so she can sort out finances, and Martisse has also been included so that she can put me in contact with the removal's company (Luker Brothers).
