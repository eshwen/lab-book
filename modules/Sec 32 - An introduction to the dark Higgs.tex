\section{An introduction to the dark Higgs (17/11/2017)}

As we'll likely be doing more dark sector work in RA1's future, I thought I should get caught up on the theory and motivation behind some of these models. One of these is the "dark Higgs", a scalar boson that gives mass to dark sector particles and has a coupling to the standard model Higgs. These models can also include a spin-1 mediator ($Z'$) that can allow dark matter to interact with Standard Model particles. An overview of some dark Higgs models and the feasibility of a search at the LHC is discussed in Ref. \cite{Duerr:2017uap}.
