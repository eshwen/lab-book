\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{T}his document is an electronic copy of the lab book I'll be keeping during my PhD. It was initially intended both as a backup in case something happens to my physical lab book, and as a searchable document if I want to find a reference, etc., quickly. But now it has assumed the role of my primary lab book for various reasons. This contains everything I have worked on since the start of my PhD including all analysis, research, service work, and also code, commands and reminders of things I may forget. It is also date-logged (in part), fully searchable and hyper-referenced.
